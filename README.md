An API wrapper for Roblox written in Python.

The purpose of this API wrapper is to expose Roblox's API for third party use and/or for individual standalone projects.
This is the first stable Python API wrapper for the Roblox API. Documentation can be found within each module. I encourage
developers to look into the codebase to better understand this wrapper and what it can truly offer. 

Supports async-compatiblity while keeping memory & network usage low. 

This is incredibly unstable but will replace ``master`` once it's stable enough for full release. 
This is intended to be ``v3.x.x`` and beyond. Please be aware that there are breaking changes in design
and will not be compatible w/ any versions prior. 

If you would like to contribute, create a pull request with the changes you made. If you have a complaint, issue or problem, create an issue and I will try to answer as fast as I can.
